The STAKEME team actively supports Web 3.0 projects by assisting in product testing, boosting testnet participation, and providing efficient development support through dedicated tools. As a trusted validator, we offer services such as RPC, snapshots, and various utility tools.

Currently, we are focused on enhancing the https://testnet.storyscan.app explorer for the Story Protocol project. However, we have recently received multiple reports from the community indicating that our explorer is inaccessible. Users of the Phantom extension have encountered notifications stating that testnet.storyscan.app has been blacklisted.

To resolve this issue, we submitted a ticket to Blowfish (#5093) requesting the removal of https://testnet.storyscan.app from the blacklist. Our intentions are entirely positive—we are committed to developing a user-friendly explorer for the community’s benefit.

Also we created issue: https://github.com/phantom/blocklist/issues/1490
